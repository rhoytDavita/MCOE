Projects

In Abstract projects are used to separate and organize teams designs. In the near future Abstract will also be able to assign permissions and user access on a project by project basis.
For a product company projects may represent different platforms or areas of work, for example your iOS, Web, Android, Marketing might make good project choices.

Saving 

When you open a file from Abstract and save work in Sketch these files are saved in a temporary location on your computers hard disk. If you close down Sketch without committing then you can easily resume work by re-opening the file from within Abstract or the recent files menu within Sketch.
Note: Saving alone doesn't protect your work if you were to lose or damage your computer as your changes will only exist locally.

Committing

When you commit your saved changes within Abstract your work is uploaded to Abstract's servers where it is stored redundantly and automatically backed up.
Commits will also be immediately synced to our servers and the machines of your team members that have access to the project so they can see your work and collaborate on it. This adds another level of safety and allows you to work offline in the unlikely event that the Abstract servers are offline for maintenance or unexpected downtime.
